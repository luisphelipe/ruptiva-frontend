# Ruptiva Fullstack Code Challenge (Frontend) - Luis Phelipe

## [Live on Netlify](https://ruptiva-luisphelipe.netlify.app/)

## [Figma design mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/Me9aTGowmBMokWzK07rUQH/ruptiva?node-id=0%3A1)

## [Backend repository](https://github.com/luisphelipe/ruptiva)

## Setup and run.

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

## Context

```
I'm not as comfortable on the frontend as I am on the backend.
> Bottlenecks by order of bottleneckness.
1. Style architecture (how to organize my component styles).
2. Lack of automated tests (need more practice there)
```

~~CSS is a big one too.~~

## TODO

1. Reorganize styles
1. Add some tests
